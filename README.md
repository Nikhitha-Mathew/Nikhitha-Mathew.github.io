## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the field of Development Economics and Economics of Education. I am interested in studying the peer-effects of classroom social diversity in developing countries and gulfs in policy responsiveness of the different stakeholders in education. Using rigorously established evidence, I would like to understand the aspects of policies that determine its effectiveness and chalk out the optimum trajectory for scaling up education policies.
